# emailBot
Automates process of sending mass emails from csv.

Conceived, Designed and Developed a Python application that automates the
process of sending mass emails. Application was used (in a school project) to
send customized emails to over 700 recipients. The application uses the f-
string and try features in Python to customize the emails for each recipient
and to recover from faulty email addresses respectively.

Note: Since content of actual email was removed, the use of f-string was also removed.
